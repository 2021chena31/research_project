"I need help, please","I've teetered on and off the edge of alcohol addiction for the last 2.5 years of my life. After a series of difficult life events, I think I've become a full blown alcoholic. I've binge drank literally every night for the past month and a half and I don't see my behaviors changing soon. For whatever reason I can't bring myself to admit my problem to others and ask for help. I'm starting to lose hope.

This is a 20 year relationship that had an unhealthy start and has had mostly unhealthy phases.  Currently unemployed and recovering from eye surgery which limits my ability to at least distract myself from myself. Got a new sponser and am currently writting a new fourth. Started off hopeful that going back through the steps would somehow work what i believe is a needed personality change but am faltering and losing hope. Weaned myself off antidepressants earlier this year and am reluctant to go back on them. I feel like they just keep me in this gray area that is neither good or bad although probably more not good than anything else.

"I made a big mistake while drinking and want to stop","I’ve had a back and forth relationship with drinking since I was 15 now that I’ve turned 18 I was drunk almost everyday for 2 weeks I was bad for it before but the easy accessibility made it easier to continue my habit daily. I went to a party and kissed people and had a sexual experience with a boy my talking stage cried a lot and wants nothing to do with me anymore. I hurt someone who had invested a lot of time in me for a cheap thrill. I also kissed my best friends girlfriend. And gave her a hickey. I said I didn’t care abt a girl I think I was starting to love and I feel very guilty. I ruined half my friendships and all due to my reckless selfish behaviour while drinking. Has anyone ever met a nice addict? I’d say no, we’re selfish, always chasing cheap thrills I don’t want this to end like the first time I was addicted to alcohol, this time I don’t intend to limit myself, I intend to stop for good.

"Recovery / Time Management - Balance","Hi all,

Just something that has been on my mind recently, I wanted to ask the group about. I sometimes get anxious thinking that I am putting almost too much time into recovery at the expense of my work and music career.

I mean, when I add up all the time spent in meetings, travelling to meetings, outreach calls, reading literature, doing step work, it certainly does add up. Now, the caveat is, I absolutely need it, and love it, and it's probably the sole reason why my life has improved so much. However, I probably put about as much time into it as my music passion which I am still building.

I do about 2 live meetings a week, and also sometimes a daily Zoom. I know that isn't abnormal at all. 

I just sometimes find with getting to meetings, and then doing gym, social stuff, and appointments, I sometime feel like I haven't got much done on the career front. I am self-employed so manage my own hours.

Does anyone else find this? How do you time manage gym, recovery, social life and work? Do you just not worry about it, or do you have a system? I can't imagine how much harder it must be with kids and running a business... I mean currently I am fairly light on responsibilities at 31.

I have been trying to do Al-Anon, ACA, SLAA + AA, therapy and counselling too, so perhaps I've overdone the quality and should focus more on quality? Or, just keep ploughing forward getting as much recovery in as possible and let the chips fall where they may.

I feel I need daily meeting pretty much otherwise I do get a bit low sometimes. I think it's the amount of phone calls perhaps that I need to be more boundaried about. But I suppose a lot of my friends now are recovery friends so it makes sense to be speaking more often.

Anyway just a morning ramble.

Hope everyone has a good day.

Many thanks!",u/Element910,7,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/u71yg9/recovery_time_management_balance/,

"Daily Reflections : Apr 19","BROTHERS IN OUR DEFECTS

We recovered alcoholics are not so much brothers in virtue as we are brothers in our defects, and in our common strivings to overcome them.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 167

The identification that one alcoholic has with another is mysterious, spiritual - almost incomprehensible.  But it is there.  I 'feel' it.  Today I feel that I can help people and that they can help me.  It is a new and exciting feeling for me to care for someone; to care what they are feeling, hoping for, praying for; to know their sadness, joy, horror, sorrow, grief; to want to share those feelings so that someone can have relief.  I never knew how to do this - or how to try.  I never even cared.  The Fellowship of A.A., and God, are teaching me how to care about others.

"Thank you","My name is Werner and I'm an alcoholic

Dear AA's, today I have my 41st AA birthday. When I called at Easter in 1981 at the AA contact telephone at Zurich/Switzerland, completely desperate and in the realization that I finally had to do something for me, I would not even have dreamed that I may write these lines today.

My higher power are and remain the AA groups. Without them, I would rest on a hill for a long time.

Since I have people who understand me, do not condemn me and help me to  stand my 24 hours without going to drink.

Thank you for still learning from you.

Despite everything that happens currently on this crazy world, life is worth living for me and I enjoy my last years of life in the warm and mostly sunny Thailand, cared for from my dear Thai woman.

Good 24 hours

"homeless member causing problems:","Today there was an issue at our meeting hall. A member that comes around alot was causing problems. The manager of the place we rent for our meeting hall got involved. 

We were standing outside talking when the homeless guy walked up to us and asked for a cigarette. I only vape so I said no I don't have one. He then proceeded to put tobacco inside of a weed pipe and smoke right in front of everyone. Not okay. A member was triggered and he was asked to stop.

Then the landlord walks up to us and asks who's in charge. He then told us that the homeless guy was at another building at the complex pissing on a wall, ripping down a no trespassing sign and digging through trash all over the ground. 

I volunteered to go and talk to him. I walked up to him and told him he can't be claiming to be a part of our group and acting like that because it is jeopardizing the place we rent for our meetings. I offered to help him pick up his stuff but he said he didn't want help. 

I'm so angry that this happened. It's really frustrating. I know that everyone is welcome but this is out of hand. Why didn't he just use the bathroom in the fucking meeting hall? He obviously has mental health issues.

"am I mentally ill? or just an alcoholic who isnt really doing the deal?","So Ive got 3 years sobriety. Had a spiritual awakening when I came in, rode that joyous pink cloud of heaven and had God moments and felt plugged into this Power. It was like a whole new experience of life and it was incredible. Fast forward, and after my 2 yr mark i started having health problems. Started taking supplements and probiotics like only an alcoholic would, to try and cure myself. Some of the stuff I was taking was messing with my mental health, making me irritable etc. Went to a psych, who put me on an antipsychotic bc she said my symptoms sounded like Bipolar. Meanwhile after that health issue started, my focus turned away from God and back towards myself. I became the center again and my whole focus was how i felt, what i could do to better myself, me me me. Went to less meetings and stopped trying to help new guys. Basically coasted on a easy routine and did things like it was a checklist. Pray check, go to a meeting check, go to work check. I started to feel empty inside again, The psych drugs fd me up and i got off them which was a hell I wouldnt wish anyone. I then make an appointment to see a functional medicine dr. I go to the appointment and the receptionist is a girl on my amends list. Crazy coincidence? anyway I made amends and saw a dr who prescribed some peptide that futher made me depressed. So here I am, lost as all hell, empty inside, knowing that there is a God but feeling very disconnected. Not knowing if I really need pills to sort out my mental health and what doctors I can trust to treat my autoimmune issue.

No longer do I have to beat back the memories of my poor choices and behaviors. No longer do I carry around resentment and fear. I can be happy, I can be aware of the little things in life that I used to pass me by because I was too focused on myself. My children no longer scurry when I come into a room.  My thoughts and opinions are actually sought after because I can actually listen without somehow making the situation about me. No longer do I suffer from the spiritual malady that afflicted my soul for so long. You see, I AM RECOVERED.

There are times when I shed tears because I am so grateful for the life that I live today. To wake up in the morning knowing that my life has value and I have a purpose is priceless. In these four years, with God's grace, I have attained a degree and gotten a job that secures my families future and my sober legacy. Going back is not an option as I will surely die a lonesome and miserable death.

Today I live HAPPY, JOYOUS, and FREE.

"i'm not sure what to do?","i've always enjoyed drinking. my parents were alcoholics and i've done it since i was very, very young. i like the social aspect of it as well- partying, going out for a beer, all that. however i think it's become a huge problem.

i'm a very social, extroverted person. i'm always outside, never alone. but what if i'm not? one of my friends suggested that i seek refuge in not being at home and drinking and i'm beginning to realize that this is true. spring break has not helped. i've been drinking nearly everyday for two weeks, spending an incredible amount of money on it and always getting pretty drunk. it doesn't help that i'm pretty big on the music scene, i go to concerts and festivals extremely often (although this is mostly for the fun and entertainment factor, i can have fun sober). most people that i surround myself with aren't even alcoholics but they do enjoy a couple of beers on a concert night. i'm starting college in a few months and with the amount of alcohol there, i'm not very close to considering abstinence.

i still want to drink, i'm not excluding the possibility of getting drunk on a saturday night out every once in a while, but i'm not sure how to reduce my intake. is it as easy as not go out as much? do i need to improve myself first in some way? any advice is appreciated, even self-love tips or whatnot. thanks!",u/Emergency-Print-9720,7,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/u6eqre/im_not_sure_what_to_do/,

"Daily Reflections : Apr 18","SELF-HONESTY

The deception of others is nearly always rooted in the deception of ourselves... When we are honest with another person, it confirms that we have been honest with ourselves and with God.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 17

When I was drinking, I deceived myself about reality, rewriting it to what I wanted it to be.  Deceiving others is a character defect - even if it is just stretching the truth a bit or cleaning up my motives so others would think well of me.  My Higher Power can remove this character defect, but first I have to help myself become willing to receive that help by not practicing deception.  I need to remember each day that deceiving myself about myself is setting myself up for failure or disappointment in life and in Alcoholics Anonymous.  A close, honest relationship with a Higher Power is the only solid foundation I've found for honesty with self and with others.

My younger brother is moving in with me this week. He’s always been incredibly skinny. When his tonsils were removed at age 9/10 he lost 15 pounds and my mother became hysterical because he was already underweight and she was worried for him—this kind of gives you an idea of what his body fat % is like.  He struggles with alcohol addiction, and I know when my mom stayed with him last fall he had lost weight he really couldn’t bear to lose and was deathly—and scarily—thin. 

I understand his alcohol issues are serious, but it’s not something that is going to change short term. 

My question is what meals could I make that are packed in nutrients and carbs that will keep him healthy while he navigates through his alcohol addiction? He eats pretty much anything and I don’t mind cooking if it will keep him healthy while he recovers from his alcohol addiction. 

Please be kind when you answer. I know his alcohol addiction needs to be fixed ASAP, but we do not have the closest relationship and I know if I pester him about it he will leave.

I'm also struggling with thinking I'm too unique for this program. I get a lot of blank stares when people ask me about my story. I was sleeping on the streets at one point in my life and managed to eventually kick a drug habit without rehab or any other help. I don't know what to say other than that I was scared of dying and sick of the constant Psychosis. I always feel bad after talking with people who don't understand because they were able to go to rehab, then I feel resentful when I hear them talking about their current relationship with their family or how they still ask them for money.

"I'm (27m) not sure if the program is right for me","I've been drinking since I was 15 and substance use got me into alot of trouble when I was younger. I dropped out of school to party and I got a dui when I was 18. Went to jail for stealing alcohol at 17 and again for marijuana at 17, each time for a week. I was a daily weed user for years and I was involved in the marijuana industry for work and was involved in illicit cross state distribution of the drug. I got out of that because I didn't want to go to prison and was never able to quit smoking weed until I decided to become a truck driver so I stopped for the drug testing. Since that point I started drinking more heavily since I had cut back alot after getting the dui at 18. That was about 3 or 4 years ago and my drinking has gone through periods of varying severty since then.



I went to my first meeting last night. It was a young persons' meeting. They took me a side room for a "1st step meeting" 3 guys told me their story. While I related to alot of what they were saying I'd say my problem is nowhere near as severe as there's. Right now my drinking is pretty much limited to the weekends, I've been hungover at work like 3 times in the past year. But on the weekends (and not every weekend or even every other weekend) I'll go to the store and buy 2 tall boys, go home and drink them, then drive(drunk) back to the store and buy another, then repeat the process. In the past I've probably made 4 trips to the store in one night. Couple months ago, I drove home from the bar damn near blackout drunk. Everytime I go to visit my family at my homestate, I get very drunk around all my aunts, uncles, and cousins. While I usually don't do anything horrible, I'm always embarrassed for getting that drunk. 


I am just tired of the depression I get the day after drinking. It makes my weekends when i drink completely unproductive. I am afraid I will get another dui or get into an accident and kill someone. Another dui would ruin my career. 


But the guys that shared their story with me at the meeting,  I had trouble relating to them. I've heard from aa podcasts that you are supposed to listen to the similarities and not the differences, but it was hard to feel like I wasn't a real alcoholic. I've never been dependent on alcohol. I've never drank more than 4 days or 5 days in a row probably. I showed up to work after drinking a couple times in the past but that was years ago. These guys were talking about going to work drunk or dead hungover every single day. Going to prison for robbery. Losing job after job. I've never lost a job due to using. At least not directly, I have quit a job because I couldn't handle the stress of it. I was smoking pot at the time and I think it made me unmotivated and hurt my mentall sharpness so it made it hard for me to keep up with the workload.



I hadn't drank for 10 days before going to the meeting. In the past year I've had stretches for weeks and weeks, I think even 6 weeks one time where I didn't drink. 



Idk. They were really nice, a group of 6 of us went to to eat afterwards. I suffer from shyness. I fealt I didn't belong there with them, and they didn't want me there, even though they were all very friendly. I fealt like a hanger on or something.

"Engaging with AA during times that challenge your spirituality","Last month, my mom somewhat suddenly died of cancer. On her birthday, February 29, we were celebrating her birthday and giving her gifts to prepare her for vacations she'd be taking in May. By March 19, she was gone.

All the while, my family was praying constantly, her bedroom door was covered with taped-on cards sending healing energy and promises of prayer, and her name was read during the intercessions in the church I grew up going to. Obviously, this wasn't enough to influence the trajectory of her disease.

In the two or so years that I've been in and out of AA, I've always struggled with a higher power (which, I know, isn't exactly unique to a lot of us). I went to Catholic school for 14 years, and that'll pretty much guarantee that you'll grow up to be a secular adult. As a result, I've never been able to fully go through the program, always getting stuck at step 3.

I haven't been to a meeting since her passing because I cannot bring myself to sit and listen to the ways a higher power saved the lives of many while knowing prayer did not save the life of the person who made me want to get sober and save my own life. I do not want to go on some nihilistic rant like an edgy atheist reddit teenager during a meeting, but my belief that engaging with a higher power can influence our lives' outcomes has been completely wiped out.

I still haven't drank, my last drink was about 9 months ago, the week she was diagnosed. But I want to improve my life, for her and for myself. If anyone has any tips on how to approach AA, or sobriety in general, while dealing with some stuff that challenges a spiritual mindset, I'm all ears.

"Someone just replied to my last post on here (almost two weeks ago) calling me pathetic.",parse error.
"I was convinced AA would not work for me.","TL;DR at the bottom. 

When I got sober I went to Life Ring and SMART recovery meetings and looked into Refuge Recovery as well. I struggled mainly with the deity driven spirituality explicitly outlined in the basic text of AA. I did, and still do, see the chapter to the agnostics as condescending and small minded.

My difficulty with recovery programs other than AA was availability. In my area there was one Life Ring meeting a week, compared to dozens of daily AA meetings. So I went to those. I found some interesting things in AA. Although I was fully convinced that my fundamentally different understanding of the basic reality of our existence; specifically: there are no gods, meant that AA would not work for me long term. I recognized that if you were able to believe in those things then AA was a great resource. It was working for so many people. I have always known that usefulness breeds contentment and satisfaction. Even though I was convinced that AA would not work for me, I knew it worked for others. I began doing what I could to be useful to AA itself. 

Here’s what I did:

Set up and tear down meetings. Make coffee. Welcome people arriving to the meeting. Facilitate the running of the meeting as needed. That new person walking through the door is here for a meaningful experience with a way of living that will help solve their difficulties. I do what I can to ensure the meeting is there for them. Even though I personally disagree with some of the core tenets. 

I maintain a definite service commitment. I have been an Intergroup representative to the meeting I chose to serve. I have been an Intergroup Chairperson. I chose to serve as Intergroup is often the first contact a person looking for recovery has. They are often the connection between groups that facilitates a cohesive and meaningful cooperation of the fellowship in an area. They are often a ‘one-stop-shop’ for all things AA. I was often overwhelmed with the specific usefulness I felt while serving the AA community there, even though I have a fundamentally different belief system.

I participate in General Service. This is the organized service structure that ensures the health, usefulness and longevity of the AA fellowship on a worldwide level. As I represent my group to the district and area, I am often overwhelmed with the massive responsibility AA has in facilitating recovery to anyone who would have it. I am awed at the humility, foresight, cooperation and selflessness practiced at the organizational level of the fellowship as a whole. To be a part of a thing that operates on a foundation so contrary to any other organization I have ever experienced is inspiring. I’m always amazed that at this level I have far fewer personal differences with the people I serve and interact with than in any other AA setting. My fundamentally different beliefs have almost zero relevance here. 

The story here is that as I serve AA to the best of my ability, my gripes, disagreements and differences become insignificant. Almost imperceptibly, I realize that my differing belief and my belonging in AA are not mutually exclusive. I am part of this thing. I have found a place that serves me well, because I have chosen to serve it well. 

I wrote this in an effort to make my experience useful to others. In the hope that it could provide a different perspective on belonging in AA. In the process I have once again realized my part in a powerful and meaningful fellowship. I walk away from this ridiculously long post in a much better mood than I when started it. Serving you has served me. 

If you made it this far; get a sponsor, work the steps to the best of your ability (yeah, I know, they seem ridiculous), find ways to serve the people AA would help, find ways to serve AA to help those people.

The meaningful relationships I have built in AA have all centered around those things. I have connections that make life worthwhile that I could have never imagined. 


tl;dr: 
It is irrefutable that AA works for many people. Even if I don’t believe it will work for me, serve it well to benefit the people it would help.",u/jswiftly79,18,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/u5pvq3/i_was_convinced_aa_would_not_work_for_me/,

"Daily Reflections : Apr 17","LOVE AND FEAR AS OPPOSITES
All these failings generate fear, a soul-sickness in its own right.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 49

'Fear knocked at the door; faith answered; no one was there.'  I don't know to whom this quote should be attributed, but it certainly indicates very clearly that fear is an illusion.  I create the illusion myself.  I experienced fear early in my life and I mistakenly thought that the mere presence of it made me a coward.  I didn't know that one of the definitions of 'courage' is 'the willingness to do the right thing in spite of fear.'  Courage, then, is not necessarily the absence of fear.  During the times I didn't have love in my life I most assuredly had fear.  To fear God is to be afraid of joy.  In looking back, I realize that, during the times I feared God most, there was no joy in my life.  As I learned not to fear God, I also learned to experience joy.

We speak every day and spent a lot of time together before rehab. He has 7 days left before he comes home and plans 90 days of meetings daily after day job to avoid cocktail hour.

I am seeking advice from alcoholics who have quit drinking who were dating/in a relationship pre rehab/quitting. What should I know? What should I prepare for? What should I do? What should I not do? 

About him: athletic, high functioning professional, comfortable talking about his emotions, has been in therapy for a while pre rehab but only once a month. High desire to better himself through therapy and quitting drinking. 

FWIW we are not in a committed relationship but I’d like us to be and I think he feels the same but I’m worried this could change. I also don’t will not put this pressure on him right as he’s out of rehab. His recovery is paramount to him and I. That being said I will need to know something eventually.

I was on the right path for a little while after that, until I spiraled out of control after one night on the piss - lead to a bender and ended with me coming home in the morning after going to the 24/7 bottle-0.
The damage is done. I've really fucked up. My partner quit his job to care for the kids and kicked me out. I haven't had a drink since. I need to earn his trust back, I'm not going to give up on a 10 year relationship on my family. 

I know it won't be an easy fix and the road ahead is filled with pain. I'll do anything to make this right.

New here and thought I’d make a post and introduce myself.

I’ve been a regular routine drinker for a long time now. Originally sticking to Scotch, Rum etc.

Eventually limiting myself to just beer. I don’t go out drinking, only having tins in my house.

The problem is it is clearly not good for my health. I drink on my weekends only, but this is usually 3 nights with 5x 500ML 6% beers… which works out to 15 beers a week, or 7.5L of beer.

Clearly this is extremely unhealthy for me and I have tried cutting down, but it simply doesn’t work and becomes a repeating cycle.

"How to get a creepy AA "old-timer" to just leave me alone","So as background, I'm a sober guy.  I've taken all 12 steps.  I'm active in the fellowship.  I have a home group and a sponsor.  I've held multiple general service positions.  I actively sponsor other men.

There's a creepy older guy in the group that has fallen on hard times.  I listened to him a few times after the meetings, and he's decided he's going to attach himself to me.  He gravitates towards me at every meeting I attend.  He calls me two or three times a day.  Most of the time, I don't even answer, but if I have nothing going on, I've been willing to listen.

Here's the thing.  Supposedly he is 20+ years sober.  In our discussions I've found out he's a stoner, is addicted to prescription benzos, he takes other peoples meds too.  He's a child sex offender.  He regularly hires hookers and is a porn addict.  He has multiple legal troubles related to his lifestyle and is facing jail time at some point later this year.  

I know all this because this is all he wants to talk about with me.  I don't want to even hear about it.  That's his deal.

I've talked to my sponsor, and he suggests I stop taking his calls and avoid him at meetings.  I can do that more than I am already, but at some point it just becomes outright rude.  I know the dude is in pain, but I just want him to leave me the fuck alone.

"Recovery and Jobs","Hey everyone,   
I'm a 29M and I've been sober for 6 months now.  A big part of the reason I started going to the rooms was because I couldn't hold onto a job.  Long story short I've been able to hold this current job for the past 8 months.  I am very happy with the way my life has been going but I'm not the biggest fan of my job at the moment.  About 3 weeks ago I was given the opportunity to take on more responsibility at work and the stress has been pretty overwhelming to the point where I'm falling into old habits of looking for another job before anything bad has really happened, skipping meetings, and not exercising on a consistent basis (which is a big recovery tool of mine).  I feel embarrassed to talk about it with family and friends because they've seen the transformation (for the better) since I've started and have put work into my sobriety.  So I guess my question is, is it reasonable to look for something else or should I just hold on and hope for the best?

"Daily Reflections : Apr 16","ANGER: A 'DUBIOUS LUXURY'

If we were to live, we had to be free of anger.  The grouch and the brainstorm were not for us.  They may be the dubious luxury of normal men, but for alcoholics these things are poison.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 66

'Dubious luxury.'  How often have I remembered those words.  It's not just anger that's best left to non-alcoholics; I built a list including justifiable resentment, self-pity, judgmentalism, self-righteousness, false pride and false humility.  I'm always surprised to read the actual quote.  So well have the principles of the program been drummed into me that I keep thinking all of these defects are listed too.  Thank God I can't afford them - or I surely would indulge in them.

"Wierd dreams","Totally wierd dreams last night. I don't remember them all, just waking up a lot and thinking wtf? But I definitely remember dreaming that I had some drinks in one dream and confessing to my bf. I recall that I hadn't had a huge amount of alcohol but was fairly intoxicated. I remember feeling regretful and upset with myself, also ashamed but determined to be honest with my bf in my dream. I can't remember what triggered me to drink in the dream. 
After the dream woke me up I had a cigarette at 4am and I had a bit of a head spin. The random thought popped into my head that I'd have a mouthful of vodka and go back to sleep. I don't have any alcohol here and don't want any. I think the thought just came up because of old habits and the strange feeling of a head spin. It wasn't a craving, just like an old habit popping into my head.
Anyway, I'd felt pretty stressed out the last few days and I did have way too much sugar yesterday. Do you think that caused me to have a disturbed night full of wierd dreams? I have been sleeping well generally.

"Displaying your sobriety chips?","First, what are your thoughts on displaying sobriety chips? Do you do it? If so, why? If not, why not? Let's discuss it!

This time around, I'm about 2.5 months sober (longest yet) and feeling great about it, and I attribute that partly to AA. I think that on my 1 year anniversary, I'm going to invest in some kind of display case. I like the shadow box ones. I'm also going to buy one of those nice, hefty sobriety chips to put in it, and then another every year that I remain sober, as a little reward/reminder to myself of how far I've come. This is really just for me though. Hardly anyone else will ever see it that isn't also in the program, or at least that doesn't already know I am. I live a pretty secluded life and this will be tucked away in a dimly lit corner anyway.

The second reason for this post is that I thought it might be fun for those of us that do display our chips, to share with one another how we go about doing it. And don't be shy with the pics! Besides, I'm not married to the shadowbox idea so I could use some inspiration lol.

"I'm sitting in my car outside the ER for the third time this week and I'm more nervous today than I was the last two times.","I'm brand new to this sub. I never felt attracted to the idea of AA. I'm stubborn and don't like admitting that a substance has more control over me than I have over myself. For years I always considered my willpower to be stronger than an addiction...but in the past few months, I'm starting to realize I'm not as strong as I thought.

I'm 30 years old, I was never a drinker until I turned 21 then a five year long abusive relationship led me to drinking. For the last nine years it was only beer. I never touched hard liquor. However, I drank A LOT of beer. At my peak, I had a seizure the day after drinking 15 7% IPAs without any food. It was a long week of 12+ beers per day without much to eat. After my seizure, I quit almost cold turkey...worst three days of my life. That lasted about 2 and a half months...then March of 2020 came. I fell right back into it but really focused on not letting myself fall as hard as I did before. It started with one or two beers per day, then four, then six, then between six and eight for the next two years. This February I tried to cut back again but started to notice withdrawal symptoms. I didn't want to go through the same experience I had before, so I thought it might be an easier transition for my body if I just bought some fireball to sip on to mitigate the shakes and sweats. It started with 200ml, then 400ml, then 600ml...and for the last three days it's been 750ml/day. Half at lunch, half at dinner. 

My previous ER visits this week were for heart concerns. My BP is high, my heart rate is high, and on monday it felt like someone was taking a needle and stabbing it into my heart for a few seconds at a time. They ran every conceivable test they could in and around my chest. Three EKGs, two Xrays, a CT scan, and more blood tests than I ever care to do again. Turns out, my heart, lungs, kidney, and liver are all perfectly fine. I'm the image of health. But today my morning bowel movement was dark...like really dark..so I have to head back in. 

I'm scared. I'm angry with myself for letting this happen again, and I have no idea where I sit right now on the scale of severe alcoholism. I'm ready to seek help, but i don't know my options...I know there are meetings around me I can go to, and I'll likely go to one this weekend, but I dont know how far gone I am. What if they tell me there's nothing wrong again? What If I use that as an excuse to get even worse?
